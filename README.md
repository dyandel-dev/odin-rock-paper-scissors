# Project Overview

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. The objective of this project is to practice fundamental **JavaScript** concepts by creating an interactive game that runs entirely in the browser console.

This project also serves as an introduction to using **Git** and the **terminal** to manage code changes throughout the development process.
